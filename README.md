# Waddle
A office Culture App with a lot of heart.

Waddle has been submitted as a hackathon project for SAP VanHack 2022, where the project was placed as a 2nd runner up to a total of 35 student projects that were formed over a weekend.

## Features
* A virtual sticky note creation page to draw
* A home 'desk' location to see all the sticky notes your colleagues left at your virtual desk
* A replay of your colleague's message by brush strokes
* An aggregation of company events -- local, global, and regional
* Waddl - waddle to another colleague's virtual desk to view their collection of sticky notes from others!

## What's Next
Our team is occupied with school work at the moment! But, we do plan to be able to host this project in the future for all to share in the delight of Waddle.
